# The Open Textbook Database

A simple website for the open textbook database developed at [Paperight](http://paperight.com) and hosted by [Electric Book Works](http://electricbookworks.com).

In the textbook-publishing world, the Golden List is one that lists which books are prescribed at universities. Every company grows theirs secretly and guards it closely. Not having a list is a huge barrier to entry for new publishers, who start with zero intel on their market, versus the biggies who know exactly how many students use a given book in a given place, and where they buy it. 

At Paperight, in our bold-if-naive attempt to revolutionise the university textbook market, we tried to build an [open textbook database](http://textbookdatabase.co.za), aiming to get publishers, booksellers and universities to collaborate to build and maintain it. To kickstart it, we spent months on the phone calling lecturers around the country to ask for lists of prescribed books. Many thought we were crazy, spies, or worse. But we eventually gathered a list of over 2000 prescriptions, including every class at UCT. The idea was that if everyone had this data, everyone would sell more books more efficiently. Win-win! 

We pitched it at a national publishers' and booksellers' convention and the silence was deafening. Not one person was interested in even talking about it. Four months later we closed Paperight, and the only people who've contacted us since about the database have been researchers. Perhaps, someday, it'll ride again.
